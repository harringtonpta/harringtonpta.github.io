		A big thank you to all those who participated in the Fun Run! It was a wonderful first event of the school year filled

		 and all the other teachers who entertained and cheered us on from the sidelines. A special thanks to Harry (or Harrietta?) the
		 Hawk who never ceases to make us all smile from ear to ear! And last but certainly not least, a HUGE shout out goes to Lynne Sheely

		 The concession stand was a huge hit and most things sold out! We had a great turnout overall

		 <h3 style="color:blue">The METCO Program</h3>
		 The METCO Program (Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunities) is a voluntary integration 
		 program that provides a suburban public school education for African-American, Hispanic and Asian
		 students from Boston. It provides Lexington students, families and staff an opportunity to benefit
		 from a culturally diverse learning environment. Lexington Public Schools have participated since 1968. <br /><br />

		The METCO Family/Friends program at Harrington connects Lexington and Boston children and their families to depend and broaden
		 relationships through the sharing of family, cultural and social experiences in their respective communities. It's one way we live
		 the Harrington value of "We All Belong!" <br /><br />

		On scheduled Friday half-days throughout the school year, Family/Friends gather for lunch and play time.
		 Here are some photos of the fun things some families have done together for the first two play dates during
		 the Fall semester: outdoor lunch, visiting LexFarm, Rindge Park, and Arlington Reservoir; and even meeting and walking a baby alpaca
		 (18 months, named Luca) from Silk Fields Farm (with Harrington METCO alum parent Kim Goldinger)!<br /><br />

		If you're interested in learning more about the METCO Family/Friends program, including but not limited to volunteering
		 during the remaining play date sessions through the rest of the school year (Fridays 1/21, 3/18, 5/27, 6/17),

		   <b>Call for Lunch Volunteers!</b> The Green Team is in need of parent and caregiver volunteers to assist with sorting, recycling, and
		   compost during lunch periods. This program was in full swing pre-pandemic and
		   in order to start it up again we need your help!  This is a great way to
		   see your child and meet their friends during the school day. You don't have to
		   be a recycling or composting expert as you will mainly provide oversight to the
		   kids. Lunch locations have changed and expanded this year due to COVID
		   protocols so we will be starting with the younger grade levels and expanding to
		   the older grades as our volunteer force grows. We need volunteers every Monday-Thursday between 10:45 and 1:15. Help
		   out for half an hour or the entire lunch period if you are able. Follow this

			This report includes the weekly snapshot of the total counts of LPS students
			and staff under quarantine or who have tested positive for COVID-19.  It is
			important to note that staff and students may be in quarantine due to exposure outside of school.
			This report also features data published by the state of Massachusetts (MA's COVID-19 dashboard).  
			Coding corresponds to criteria and key indicators for COVID-19 suppression described by the Harvard Global Health
			Institute.  LPS will update these numbers every Friday.

			On August 20, 2021, Lexington School Community received this 
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjUyF73EoozC8bqQM3ASOXrcHdSxL8xsxVUCveinhvc/edit">letter</a>
			regarding updated COVID-19 Back-to-School Protocols, 
			which included FAQs related to LPS COVID-19 testing. For the 2021-22 school year, our testing program will be multifaceted and include:
			<ul><br>
				<li>Individual testing on symptomatic individuals: is a nasal swab performed by the school nurse when individuals present 
				symptoms while at school</li>
				<br>
				<li>Individual testing on close contacts (Test and Stay): for asymptomatic close contacts and is a daily nasal swab performed 
				by the school nurse or other qualified healthcare professional for 5-7 days following exposure.</li> 
				<br>
				<li>Routine COVID-19 safety check (previously referred to as ‚Äúpooled testing‚Äú): collecting and performing a test on a group 
				of samples for routine testing. For efficiency and similar to our program last year, any necessary follow-up individual 
				testing would happen on the same individual samples already sent to the lab. LPS will provide more details in the coming weeks 
				about how staff and students will participate in routine safety checks.</li>  
			</ul>
			

			
			
Please note for students and staff to participate in any aspects of our testing program, we must have a signed consent on file before any testing can occur. If we do NOT have a consent form on file, students will need to be quarantined for a minimum of 7 days in the event they are identified as a close contact or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.  
<br><br>
Action Needed: To view and complete the state provided COVID-19 testing consent form for yourself or on behalf of your child, please click <a href="https://www.cic-health.com/consent/ma?district=Lexington">here</a> (and then click ‚Äúconsent now‚Äù to sign).   Families with more than one child enrolled in LPS must complete a consent form for each child. 
<br><br>
We will continue to update and maintain information about <a href="https://sites.google.com/lexingtonma.org/lps-covid19-return-to-school/covid-19-testing">LPS COVID-19 TESTING</a> testing on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/lexingtonma.org/lps-covid19-return-to-school/your-health-safety-well-being?authuser=">district website</a>, where community members can always look for updates and information about LPS health and safety measures.
